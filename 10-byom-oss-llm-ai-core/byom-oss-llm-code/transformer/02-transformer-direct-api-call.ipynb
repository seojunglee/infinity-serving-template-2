    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will test out [Microsoft's Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct) with the [custom inference server with hugging face transformers library](app/server.py) in SAP AI Core. Enhance [btp-generative-ai-hub-use-cases/01-social-media-citizen-reporting](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-generative-ai-hub-use-cases/tree/main/01-social-media-citizen-reporting) with Vision capability powered by the Phi-3-vision models, in which the issues of public facilities reported by citizen can be automatically analyzed by the Vision API with its image. <br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, You can also run another transformer-based open-source LLM on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), like [microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running this notebook, please assure you have performed the [Prerequisites](../../README.md) and [01-deployment.ipynb](01-deployment.ipynb). As a result, a deployment of transformer scenario is running in SAP AI Core.<br/><br/>\n",

    "- Connect to SAP AI Core via SDK\n",
    "- Check the status and logs of the deployment\n",
    "- Pull model from ollama model repository through API\n",
